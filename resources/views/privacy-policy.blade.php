                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">3. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Formigo acts as an intermediary between Researchers and Respondents. When you respond to a survey, your responses—including any information you voluntarily provide—are shared with the Researcher who created that survey. Formigo does not control how Researchers use that data once received. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                    We may disclose information only:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 text-gray-600">
                    <li>When required by law or legal process.</li>
                    <li>To prevent fraud, abuse, or unauthorized access to our systems.</li>
                    <li>To enforce our Terms of Use or protect our platform’s integrity.</li>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">4. Data Security</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    We use encryption, firewalls, and access controls to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. Only authorized personnel may access sensitive data when necessary to operate or maintain the platform.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                    While we take all reasonable precautions, no system is completely secure. Users are encouraged to use strong passwords and protect their login credentials.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    We retain account and survey data only as long as necessary to provide our services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. Researchers may store collected responses for as long as they deem necessary under their own policies.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    You may request to access, correct, or delete your personal data at any time. Account deletion will remove your profile and associated information from our systems, but survey responses already shared with Researchers may remain with them.
